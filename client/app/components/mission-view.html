        <h3> Vision & Mission </h3>
        <p>In our vision, the wheel does not need to be re-invented, by creating new tools or infrastructure. A great investment has been made in the last decades to provide global, maintainable infrastructures of storage, processing, etc.</p>
        <p>The Oil & Gas Virtual Research Environment has been created in an effort to present researchers with a social interface for sharing and discussion of information and tools useful for research in this domain, taking advantage of all the created infrastructures for a sustainable and reliable information system.</p>
        <p>In the future, all researchers will use a virtual research environment, sharing their lab notes with their team or the world.</p>
